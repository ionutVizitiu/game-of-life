# Game of life

This is a small implementation of John Horton Conway's "Game of Life" using Angular.

In this stage, the user can:
- configure the canvas (width, height, colors, frames per second)
- start a game with random cells
- see the next generation
- start the game in autoplay mode
- stop the autoplay mode

Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/ionutVizitiu/game-of-life.git`
Go inside the project: `cd game-of-life`
Install dependencies: `npm i`
Run the project: `ng serve -o`
See it in action

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
